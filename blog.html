    <h1> The Blog of William Kelley from Wolverinesoft Game Studio!</h1>

    <h2> Devblog 1: 1/28 to 2/11</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>These first two weeks in Wolverinesoft were an interesting Introduction to what game development is like beyond normal class projects for me. Having completed EECS 494, I was familiar with Unity and C#, which were helpful in onboarding to the studio, but there were a lot of things and tools that I learned about for the first time within Wolverinesoft. So, these first two weeks I wasn't able to contribute to the project as much as I would like to since I had to learn some tools, like Wwise, that I had never used before that were confusing and deep. However, I am excited to put these tools to use in creating a game that is better than anything else I have made before.</p>

    <h3>Wolverinesoft Meetings: 5 hours</h3>
    <p>Two Wolverinesoft meetings wer during this time: 1/28 and 2/4. The reason I account for 5 hours here is because in the 2/4 meeting the Audio team stayed an extra hour, until 2 PM, to meet with Jerry Berlongieri, a professional games sound designer. Since the audio team was having so much fun talking to Jerry we decided to stay an extra hour to talk to him. Talking to him was a really cool look into what being a real sound designer is like and he was able to give us feedback on our game sounds.</p>

    <h3>Learning Wwise: 10 hours</h3>
    <p>A big chunk of my time in the first few weeks of me being in the studio is learning Wwise, the audio middleware the audio team uses to interface with Unity. I completed the courses Wwise 101 and 201 from Audiokinetic, which were courses on sound effects and interactive music within Wwise respectively. These courses were extremely hellpful in learning Wwise since the interface was very confusing at first. Though it is still sometimes confusing, I am now able to work my way through a small part of Wwise in my Wolverinesoft projects. Though these trainings were very comprehensive and taught me a lot, due to their dense nature I probably didn't absorb as much as I wish I had and will probably be coming back to them in the future when I forget something. These courses were overall extremely helpful with Wwise and gave me a sound foundation on how to use Wwise in the future. I would provide a screenshot for this, but I don't get a certification of completion without spending $250 or so on an exam, and there is no other way to track completion, so I'm sorry.</p>

    <h3>Playtesting Project Quest: 3 hours</h3>
    <p>One of my Jira tasks for this sprint is to playtest Project Quest and report all missing audio and audio bugs. I had to play through the game a few times to catch all the ones I could find and reported them in the Discord channel for reporting bugs. I estimate this took me about 2 hours in total to document all the bugs I found.</p>
    <p>Also, I played through the game for about an hour on my own time to familiarize myself with it and understand the story.</p>

    <h3>Researching Wwise Music Bug: 5 hours</h3>
    <p>As well as playtesting the game, my other major Jira talk for this sprint is to help solve an issue in Project Quest where different music and ambiances are played over each other and at the same time instead of transitioning between each other cleanly. Though this task seems simple, I wanted to find the "correct" way to do it in Wwise so I spent a lot of time researching methods to solve this problem. Ultimately I think I understand what to do but haven't had time to do it yet since I wanted to talk it over with the other technical Audio Engineer. My biggest mistake here is thinking about the problem befure taking Wwise 201, since that is the Wwise course about interactive music that would have taught me how to solve this issue. I was too worried about this issue and wanted to solve it without habing the foundational knowledge in Wwise to really understand how to solve it, and taking the Audiokinetic course helped me way more than any Googling could since I lacked the fundamental knowledge to understand my problem. In the future, when learning a new technology like Wwise I plan to get foundational knowledge before I try to solve problems with the new technology. Overall this bug caused me the most trouble since I didn't understand how Wwise worked well enough to solve it.</p>
    <p>Overall, the solution involves setting a Wwise state when moving between scenes to trigger Wwise transitions instead of just playing events that play or stop specific audio files. To me, this seems like the best option that Wwise gives us to do this and it provides for quick and easy setup of transitions between any audio or ambient tracks. Since this is the last week of the sprint I am going to work with the other Technical Audio engineer to get this feature in the game before next Sunday, and overall I am happy I took the time to understand the problem and the best way to solve it rather than making a worse solution overall with less Wwise knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Overall this was a good introduction into Wolverinesoft and how a larger game studio works. Since I spent a lot of time learning how Wwise works I am hopeful I will be able to use that knowledge soon to finish my current Jira tasks as well as more tasks I will get in future weeks/sprints.</p>
